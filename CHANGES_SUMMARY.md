2. Replace <username>, <password>, <cluster-url> with your actual values
3. Save the file

Example:
DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://myuser:mypass123@cluster0.abc.mongodb.net/bookit?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
```

### Step 3: Run Backend (3 minutes)
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run prisma:generate
npx prisma db push
